            <p>Hi there ! I’m Rocío Egío, architect and graphic designer based in Lausanne.</p>

            <p>I’m interested in illustration, editorial design and typography, fascinated by geometry simple images,
                patterns, and fun colors.</p>

            <p>I studied architecture at UA University in Alicante, spending a year at the EPFL in Lausanne and six
                months in SISU University in Shanghai.</p>

            <p>I’ve been working as a freelance graphic designer, combining both disciplines, architecture and design to
                build attractive projects. And I also had the opportunity to work with many brands through my instagram
                account.</p>
